The metro in which the Metamorphoses is written is
celled the Dactylio Hexameter, or Heroic Hexameter, or
simply Hexameter.

'l'he Dactyl is a loct consisting ol one long and two short
syllables, thus: J. υ υ. The rhythmica] secent on the
first syllable ot this ioot is celled the Ictus, end the syl·
lable upon which the Ictus tells is called ths Thesis. The
remsinder ot the toot is called the Areo· The Dactylic
Hexam'eter is, theoreticclly, averse consisting oi six Dactyls.
The lest loct, however, always consiste oi but two syllables,
s υ or ι -. The fitth Dectyl is very rsrely replaced by
respondes (ι -). When this occurs, the verse is cslleda
Spondoe'c Verso.v Any oi the other tour Dactyls mey be
treely replaced by Spondoes.¹ So the ieet end syllables ol e
Dactylic Heremeter would be es lollows :

This long verse, it reed without a pause, would grow monot-
onous. Usually there is a pause near the middle ol the
verse, giving the effect rather ot two short verses. This
pause usually coincides with the Principal ansure. (laesura
(cottioy) takes plece cheneres the end ot the word does not
coincide with the end ol the loct. When the Oeesure comes
immedieter aiter the ictus-syllable, it is called masculine ,·
when it comes efter one ot the short s'yllebles, it is called ’
feminine. The Principul (laesura is the semiquinaria, or
Peotbome'meral, occurring in the middle ot the third toot.
The next in importence is the Soniseptonoria, or Hepbthe·
soimerol, in the middle ot the fourth ioot. When this occurs,
there is usually combined with it the Semiteroears‘a or stite
mimeral ansure' in the middle oi the second toot. Often
there is a choico oi (laesurae, and the recder in selecting the
pense should heve regard ior the punctuation end sense.

* These terme ara sometimes used in just the opposite signification.
