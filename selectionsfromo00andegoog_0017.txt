11 l'lre lintres oi ovid

Greek and Latin versification is based on the length ol
syllables, and not on the word-acoent aa in ourlangnage.
Syllables are either long (-) or short (ν), or common (sorne-
times long, sometimes short, z). One long syllable is equal
to tvo shorts. The length oi a syllable is ealled its quantity.
'l'he Latin quantities must usually be learned by eareiul
observation, bnt some usetul rules may be given:

1.Ι Α vowel before another vowel (or separated from it
only by b) is usually short, eg. mtue, pter.

2. A short vowel coming before two consonante, either in
the same word or in different words, oounts as long, and the
syllable is said to be teng by position. A double consonant
(n or s) bas the same effect as tvo consonante.

3. Π these two oonsonants be a mute and aliquid (tr, br,
ete), the syllable may remain short 3 eg. tenebrae. Suoh
syllables are usually common.

4. All diphthongs are long.

Ι Some other rules may be conveniently subjoined here τ

5. Sometimes tvo vovels, not naturally forming a diph,
thong, arsin pronunciation run together into one syllable,
eg. &moe This proeess is ealled dgnieesis or synaeresis.

6. Hiatus is the coming together oi tvo vovel munds,
one at the end ot a word, the other at the beginning ot the
next word. In Ouid this is, as a rule, permitted only when
the first word is a monosyllabis interjeotion or a polysyllabis
proper name ending with the irtus-syllable ol the fiith toot.
In-other eases this unpleasant juxtaposition oi vowel sounds
is avoided by eliminating one oi those soumis.

a. Usually the first vowel sonnd is omitted by Elision ,·
e. g. pmnouuee perque hiemes as perquiemoa

b. When the seoond word is es or est ol the verb sum, the

eis omitted by Aperensem eg. pronounee itum est as itemst

Nor} 1. Notius thath never eounta aa a oonsonant in botin.
Nora 2. Notior that tlnal am, en, anrl un are elidad, just lilre vovels
