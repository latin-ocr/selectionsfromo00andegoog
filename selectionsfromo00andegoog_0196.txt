Her. i 15: elvennhhntileohnmnamhatableotorsvlotnm. Two ob·
ieotious have been made to the·reading ah lieotore: (1) aooerding to
Homer, it vas not Hester, but Memnon, thet killed Antilochus. (i) ah
Ηιιιιιι, following Eeetorse in the preoeding line, gives offense.

'l'he seoond ohy'eotion does net strengthen the first at all. For, vhsse
the repetition is awkward and striking, it would be quite es nvkvard to
iump from Heotor in 14 to somehody else in 1o and ιωι to Hector in lo.
uuo general assertion in 14 vill naturally bs illustrated and explained in
the next verses.

Is it possible that Ovid, vrith his great memory, earetulness, and ao-
enraey, overlooked this point in Homer and wrote ab nestore without any
authority ior it 1 It ιιιιιιι ιι to me (ai. my Sooacra oi Ovid’s Heroides,
p. 16), ιιι in the absenee oi ahetter reading I have raheined ab Restare
iu the text

Ii any ohange is ιο ιι made. it should be rather in the vord Andloohem.
For insteuoe, Amphimsehnm might bs substituted. See Hom, Il. ¹111.

Her. xii. 17 ι

instead oi ιιιιιιιιι, ιιι beet MSS. give qne st semina (P.) ov quot nminat

ably a gloss explaining totidem, and replaoed some verb whioh oannot be
restored with great eonfldenoe The passage ιιι been variously emended,
most editors pntting in some word like ιιιιιιιι. 'I'he oonstruotion oi
this ιιιιιιιι would naturally be the aeine as that ot the preceding lealsest
(er unisset, as several editors have it), but that does not iit the sense nell.
He oephi io hove sowa ιιι squol number os ιιιιιίιι does not seem to be
the meaning, but rather ιι would have ιοιιιι, stating that the oue aetion
vas involved in the other. Itis, moreover, not quita eorreot to say
hostes ιιιιιι when you simply mean that ιοιιιι spring up irom the sov-
ing. 1 arn prepared to grant that these are both rather tine points, hut
they are suffloieut to ιιιιιι me to suggest a new emendation, visuras.
The word video is peculiarly applioable to the strange sight. Compare
1. 98 and Met. vn. 180, let.
